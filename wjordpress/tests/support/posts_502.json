If it&#8217;s below 40 degrees F (4 degrees C), forget layers. Just wear a T-shirt and your good winter coat. That is seriously all you need. Don&#8217;t have a coat warm enough? Well, then you should probably layer. Would you rather put on and peel off a dozen layers as you transition from indoors to outdoors and back indoors; or just throw on a coat?<\/li>\n<li>Forget gloves. Put your hands in your pockets.<\/li>\n<li>I lied, get gloves.My point is: <strong>don&#8217;t<\/strong> depend on them (unless you&#8217;re biking, but that&#8217;s another story). Be prepared to lose your gloves. Ideally, the gloves you buy have clasps, hooks, and\/or velcro so you don&#8217;t lose them. I actually have a glove\/coat combo where I can peel off my gloves and stick them onto a velcro strip on the coat. Ski jackets usually have good glove storage.<\/li>\n<li>Learn how to put on and take off your gloves with your teeth.\u00a0<em>True story<\/em>: If you&#8217;re walking down the street eating your ice cream and you need to answer your phone, you don&#8217;t want to have to put down your ice cream to mess with a glove.<\/li>\n<li>Your nose will run. Don&#8217;t use tissues. I always carry a washcloth for this. Bicyclist will know that winter gloves are designed to have a patch for wiping your nose.<\/li>\n<li>No hats. All you need are ear warmers. Even on bike. I got these foldable ear wamers on woot a loooong time ago: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woot.com\/offers\/eargrips-behind-the-head-fleece-ear-warmer-2-pack-dec-15\">http:\/\/www.woot.com\/offers\/eargrips-behind-the-head-fleece-ear-warmer-2-pack-dec-15<\/a> You can fold them for easy storage, and you can also carry them by wrapping them on your arm, freeing up valuable pocket space. Besides, hats mess up your hair.<\/li>\n<li>Do use scarves and hoods. Hoods are useful for dealing with wind, and scarves can be equivalent to wearing a whole layer. Learn the different way of tying a scarf. You can tie a scarf different ways to deal with different degrees.<\/li>\n<li>Pants: it doesn&#8217;t matter, and you don&#8217;t need long underwear. You can wear the same pants you wore in summer. Same goes for socks and shoes. Your jacket will cut the wind and cover the important bits. I don&#8217;t know what magic girls use to walk around in leg warmers. Maybe it&#8217;s the Uggs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And there you have it. With that wardrobe, I was biking around Chicago all winter in 5 degree F weather. The only modification I made for biking was I had to invest in some serious gloves. Another modification you might want is if you&#8217;re going to be standing still outdoors for a long time (why?), then you should add layers.<\/p>\n","parent":0,"link":"http:\/\/www.crccheck.com\/blog\/winter-tips\/","date":"2013-11-26T22:50:06+06:00","modified":"2014-07-17T23:54:45+06:00","format":"standard","slug":"winter-tips","guid":"http:\/\/www.crccheck.com\/blog\/?p=502","excerpt":"<p>Here are some winter tips from a Texan who was in Chicago that one time: Don&#8217;t layer.
