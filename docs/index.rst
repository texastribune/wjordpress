Since time immemorial, there has been effort after effort to make the Django
admin friendlier for writers to use as a CMS interface. The goal always being:
"Can we make Django as easy to use as WordPress?"

Well, instead of trying to make the Django admin ack like WordPress, why not
use WordPress and feed the data into Django? That is the goal of Wjordpress.
